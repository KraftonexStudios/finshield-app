# Banking Application Data Collection Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the fraud detection banking application's data collection system, security implementation, performance characteristics, and mobile compatibility. The application implements sophisticated behavioral biometrics for fraud detection through extensive data collection during user interactions.

## 1. Data Collection Architecture

### 1.1 Core Components

The application uses a multi-layered data collection architecture:

**Native Module Layer:**

- `DataCollectionModule.ts` - Main native module interface
- `DataCollectionModule.web.ts` - Web fallback implementations
- `NativeDataCollectionService.ts` - Service layer abstraction

**Data Collection Components:**

- `DataCollectionTextInput.tsx` - Keystroke pattern collection
- `TouchTrackingWrapper.tsx` - Touch gesture analysis
- `useDataCollectionStore.ts` - Centralized state management

### 1.2 Data Collection Patterns

#### Keystroke Analysis

```typescript
// Collected keystroke data includes:
- Character typed
- Timestamp (high precision)
- Dwell time (key press duration)
- Flight time (between keystrokes)
- Approximate touch coordinates
- Input context (field type)
```

#### Touch Pattern Analysis

```typescript
// Touch event data includes:
- Touch coordinates (x, y)
- Pressure levels
- Touch duration
- Gesture classification (tap, swipe, scroll, pinch)
- Velocity and acceleration
- Multi-touch detection
```

#### Device Behavioral Data

```typescript
// Device behavior includes:
- Motion sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope)
- Network information
- Device orientation
- Battery status
- Location data (when permitted)
- App usage patterns
```
